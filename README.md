Most attributes are optional except for `collection`

| Attribute                   | Value                                                      | Default              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `limit`                     | number between `1` and `100`                               | `50`                 | set a value on how the maximum amount of NFT's to show per page                                                                                                                                          |
| `network`                   | [supported chains / networks](#supported-chains--networks) | `mainnet`            | `mainnet` is the default network you can set it to `testnet` if you want to try it out first.                                                                                                            |
| `chain`                     | [supported chains / networks](#supported-chains--networks) | `wax`                | there is support for multiple chains, see [supported chains / networks](#supported-chains--networks) below.                                                                                              |

| `endpoint`                  | None                                                       | `api.neftyblocks.me` | only useful for development, API is highly customized for it's purpose.                                                                                                                                  |

#### supported chains / networks

The following blockchains are supported by the embedded marketplace

| chain         | network                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| wax (default) | mainnet (default), testnet |

#### callback URL

if a callback URL is placed as an attribute after the user has signed the transaction, the user will be redirected to the callback URL after the transaction has been completed. we will include a couple of attributes in the query string to help you with the process.

-   `tx`: the transaction hash
-   `status`: the status of the transaction (`executed` or `failed`) this still needs to be validated as successfully executed
-   `sale`: the sale id
-   `assets`: the asset ids as `"12345,12345,12345"`

while we provide some useful data it's still up to you to validate that the transaction is valid and the user did make the sale. Everybody can write to a URL so be careful.

## üé® Styling

To get your look and feel to match your project, can customize by using [css variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp).

either place this in your `style.css` css file or add a `<style> ... css here ... </style>` tag in your HTML.

```css
:root {
    /* the font-family for all text */
    --nefty-font-family: sans-serif;
    /* the default font size (best kept as is) */
    --nefty-font-size: 16px;
    /* the smaller font size (best kept as is) */
    --nefty-font-size--small: 14px;

    /* the minimum and maximum width of the cards (responsive)  */
    --nefty-card-size-min: 250px;
    --nefty-card-size-max: 1fr;

    /*  the space between cards */
    --nefty-cards-gap: 28px;

    /* border radius for all roundings of inputs, buttons, images */
    --nefty-radius: 24px;
    --nefty-radius-image: 18px;
    --nefty-radius-small: 12px;

    --nefty-color-secondary: #777e90;

    --nefty-btn-tertiary-border: #fcfcfd;
    --nefty-btn-tertiary--active: #fcfcfd;
    --nefty-btn-tertiary-bg--active: #141416;
    --nefty-btn-tertiary-border--active: #fcfcfd;

    /* backgrounds */
    /* list background in filters (schemas) */
    --nefty-bg-list-item: #141416;
    /* card mint background */
    --nefty-bg-mint: #0e0f12;
    /* all inputs (filters) */
    --nefty-bg-inputs: #23262f;
    /* card background */
    --nefty-bg-card: #23262f;
    /* loading state */
    --nefty-bg-loading: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
    /* fallback background color for images (best kept as is) */
    --nefty-bg-image: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
}
```

### ü™Ñ Advanced Styling Options

For more options we support the use of `::part` which will give you full controle to overwrite styling. [read more about ::part](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part)

## üí≤ Payment processing

As we do not expect everybody to have a login and a way to handle signing transactions, we provide a payment processor that will be used to handle the payment process. The payment processor runs on a custom domain [https://neftyblocks.me](https://neftyblocks.me) and will deal with login, signing, and getting the user back to the site from where they came.
